//! LocalGPT Core — shared library for agent, memory, config, and security.
//!
//! This crate contains the platform-independent logic consumed by the CLI,
//! server, mobile, and gen crates. It has zero platform-specific dependencies
//! and compiles cleanly for `aarch64-apple-ios` and `aarch64-linux-android`.
